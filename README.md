# Libft

Libft project from 42 School (the best you will ever see)


## Description

C programming can be very tedious when one doesn’t have access to the highly useful
standard functions. This project is about understanding the way these functions work,
implementing and learning to use them. Your will create your own library. It will be
helpful since you will use it in your next C school assignments.
Take the time to expand your libft throughout the year. However, when working
on a new project, don’t forget to ensure the functions used in your library are allowed in
the project guidelines.
